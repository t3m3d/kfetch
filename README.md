Really simple completely regular "C" programming program. It will show the user@host, Operating System, CPU brand, model, cores and threads. It also shows up to two dedicated graphics card with the vram in a used/unused bar. Currently I use the Nvidia protocols, so if you have AMD or Intel, please let me know if you have any issues. Terminal and up to 3 disks have been tested with used/unused bars. Also Ram in a used/unused percentage and bar, and uptime. If there are any features that need work or you would like added, please let me know or you are welcome to submit fixes as well! -Brian, KryptonBytes
